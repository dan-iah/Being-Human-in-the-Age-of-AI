# <div align="center"> Being-Human-in-the-Age-of-AI </div>
This project explores an exaggerated form of the reality of being human in the age of AI through video calls where each speaker has both an AI and human element visually, audibly, and in content spoken. This exaggeration is meant to highlight to us what we might be blind to seeing and numb to realising about the "artificial" and "natural" lives we live today. </div>
